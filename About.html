<font face="arial">
<p>If  a,b are natural numbers such that a>b, then the equation x + a = b is not solvable in N, the set of natural numbers i.e. there is no natural number satisfying the equation x + a = b. So, the set of natural numbers is extended to form the set I of integers in which every equation of the form x + a = b ; a,b &isin; N is solvable.  But , equations of the form xa=b,where a,b &isin; I, a &ne; 0  are not solvable in I also. Therefore, the set I of integers is extended to obtain the set Q of all rational numbers in which every equation of the form xa=b, a &ne; 0, a,b &isin; I is uniquely solvable.The equations of the form x<sup>2</sup> = 2, x<sup>2</sup>=3 etc. are not solvable in Q because there is no rational number whose square is 2. Such numbers are known as irrational numbers.The set Q of all rational numbers is extended to obtain the set R which includes both rational and irrational numbers. This set is know as the set of real numbers. The equations of the form  x<sup>2</sup>+1=0, x<sup>2</sup>+4=0 etc. are not solvable in R i.e. there is no real number whose square is a negative real number. <b>Euler was the first mathematician to introduce the symbol i (iota) for the square root of -1 i.e. a solution of x<sup>2</sup>+1=0 with the property i<sup>2</sup>=-1. He also called this symbol as the imaginary unit.</b></p></font>

<h3 align="center"> <font size="11"> Definition of complex number</h3></font></font>

<font face="arial">
	<p> If a,b are two real numbers, then a number of the form a + ib is called a <b>Complex number</b>.</p></font>
	<p><font color="red"> <i>Real and imaginary parts of a complex number : </i></font> If z = a + ib is a complex number, then 'a' is called the real part of z and 'b' is known as the imaginary part of z. The real part of z is denoted by Re(z) and the imaginary part by Im(z).</p>
<p><font color="red"> <i>Purely real and purely imaginary complex number : </i></font>
	 A complex number z is purely real if its imaginary part is zero i.i. Im(z)=0 and purely imaginary if its real part is zero i.e. Re(z)=0</p>
	<p><font color="red"> <i>Set of complex number : </i></font>The set of all complex numbers is denoted by  C  i.e.  C = a+ib : a,b &isin; R.

Since a real number 'a' can be written as a+0i. Therefore, every real number is a complex number. Hence, R &subset; C, where R is the set of all real numbers.

<p><font  size="6" color="olive" ><b> Definition : </b></font>Two complex numbers z<sub>1</sub>= a<sub>1</sub> + ib<sub>1 </sub> and z<sub>2</sub> = a<sub>2</sub> + ib<sub>2</sub>  are equal if a<sub>1</sub> = a<sub>2</sub>  and b<sub>1</sub> = b<sub>2</sub>.
i.e. Re(z<sub>1</sub>)=Re(z<sub>2</sub>) and Im(z<sub>1</sub>)= Im(z<sub>2</sub>).</p>

<h5 align="center"> <font size="11"> Conjugate of a Complex number</h5></font></font>
<p><font  size="6" color="olive" ><b> Definition : </b></font>Let z=a+ib be a complex number. Then, the conjugate of z is denoted by \( \bar{z} \) and is equal to a-ib.

Thus, z = a+ib &rArr; \(\bar{z} \) = a-ib

It follows from this definition that the conjugate of a complex number is obtained by replacing i by -i.
