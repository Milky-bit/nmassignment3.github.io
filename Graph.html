		<p> A complex number can be represented in the following forms:</p>
			<p>
				<li><b>Geometrical form</b></li>
				<li><b>Vectorial form</b></li>
				<li> <b> Trigonometric form or, Polar form</b></li>
		</p>

		<h3 align="center"> <font size="11">Geometrical Representation of a complex number</h3></font></font>
		<p> A complex number z= x = iy can be represented by a point (x,y) on the plane which is known as the <b>Argand Plane</b>.To represent z= x + iy geometrically we take two mutually perpendicular straight lines X'OX and Y'OY. Now, plot a point whose x and y coordinates are respectively the real and imaginary parts of z. This point P(x,y) represents the complex number z=x + iy.</p>

<p>If a complex number is purely real, then its imaginary pat is zero. Therefore, a purely real number is represented by a point on x - axis. A purely imaginary complex is represented by a point on y- axis. That is why x- axis is known as the real axis and y- axis, as the imaginary axis.</p>

<p>Conversely, if P(x,y) is a point in the plane, then the point P(x,y) represents a complex number z = x = iy. The complex number z = x + iy is known as the affix of the point P.</p>

<p>Thus, there exists a one- one correspondence between the points of the plane and the members(elements) of the set C of all complex numbers, i.e., for every complex number z = x + iy there exists uniquely a point (x,y)  on the plane and for every point (x,y) of the plane there exists uniquely a complex number z= x + iy.</p>

<p>The plane in which we represent a complex number geometrically is known as the <b>Complex plane</b> or <b>Argand plane</b> or the <b> Gaussian plane</b>. The point P, plotted on the Argand plane, is called the <b>Argand diagram</b>.</p>

<p>The length of the line segment OP is called the <b>modulus of z and is denoted by |z|</b>.</p>

<p>From Fig.5, we have,</p>
<p> OP<sup>2</sup> = OM<sup>2</sup> + MP<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>&rArr; OP<sup>2</sup>= x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>&rArr;  OP =  &radic;(x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup>)</p>

<p>Thus,    |z|= &radic;(x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup>) = &radic; (Re(z)<sup>2</sup> + Im(z)<sup>2</sup>)     </p>

<p>The angle &theta; which OP makes with positive direction of x-axis in anticlockwise sense is called the <b>argument or amplitude of z</b> and is denoted by <b>arg(z)</b> or <b>amp(z)</b>.</p>

<p>From Fig.5., we have,</p>
<p>tan &theta;= PM <b>&frasl;</b> OM = y <b>&frasl;</b> x = Im(z) <b>&frasl;</b> Re(z) &rArr; &theta; = tan<sup>-1</sup> (Im(z) <b>&frasl;</b> Re(z))</p>
</center>

<p>This angle &theta; has infinitely many values differing by multiples of 2 &pi;. The unique value of &theta; such that -&pi;<&theta;&le;&pi; is called the <b>principal value of the amplitude </b> or <b>principal argument</b>. This formula for determining the argument of z = x+iy has severe drawback, because z<sub>1</sub> = 1 + i &radic;3 and z<sub>2</sub> = -1 - i &radic;3 are two distinct complex numbers represented by two distinct points in the Argand plane but their arguments seem to be tan<sup>-1</sup> &radic;3 = &pi; &frasl; 3 or  4&pi;&frasl;3 which is not correct. In fact he argument is the common solution of the simultaneous trigonometric equations.</p>

<p>cos&theta; = x &frasl; &radic; (x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup>)  and, sin&theta; = y &frasl; &radic; (x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>Since the above system of equations has infinitely many solutions. Therefore, there can be infinitely many arguments of z = x+iy. The argument &theta; which satisfies the inequality -&pi; <&theta;&le;&pi; is usually known as the <b>principal argument of z </b>.</p>

		<h4 align="center"> <font size="11">Vectorial Representation of a Complex number</h4></font></font>

	<p> A complex number z = x + iy  can be represented by the position vector OP of point P(x,y) in a two dimensional plane because a complex number depends on two things viz. <b>(i) its modulus </b>and <b>(ii) its argument </b> which are also the requirements of a vector on a plane.</p>

<p> Let z = x+iy be a complex number represented by a point P(x,y) in the Argand plane. Then by the geometrical representation of z = x + iy, we obtain</p>
 
 <p>OP = |z| and, &ang;POX = &theta; = arg(z)</p>

	<p>In &#9651; POM, we obtain</p>
	<p> cos&theta; = OM &frasl; OP = x &frasl; |z| &rArr; x = |z| cos&theta;  </p>
	<p> and,  sin&theta; = PM &frasl; OP = y &frasl; |z| &rArr; y = |z| sin&theta; </p>
	<p> &therefore; z = x + iy </p>
	<p> &rArr; z = |z|cos&theta; + i|z|sin&theta; </p>
	<p> &rArr; z = |z|(cos&theta; + isin&theta;)</p>
	<p> &rArr; z = r(cos&theta; + isin&theta;), where r = |z| and &theta; = arg(z)</p>
	<p> This form of z is called a polar form of z. If we use the general value of the argument of &theta;, then the polar form of z is given by</p>

<p>z= r[cos(2n &pi; + &theta;) + i sin(2n &pi; + &theta;)], where r = |z|, &theta; = arg(z) and n is an integer. </p>
